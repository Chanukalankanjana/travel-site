      fullDescription: `Sigiriya, also known as Lion Rock, is an ancient rock fortress and palace ruin located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province, Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of rock nearly 200 meters high.

According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Culavamsa, this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (477 â€“ 495 CE) for his new capital. He built his palace on the top of this rock and decorated its sides with colorful frescoes.

The site was both a palace and a fortress. The upper palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut into the rock that still retain water. The moats and walls that surround the lower palace are still exquisitely preserved.

Sigiriya is considered one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning. It is the most visited historic site in Sri Lanka. The palace is located in the heart of the island between the towns of Dambulla and Habarane on a massive rocky plateau 370 meters above sea level.

The rock itself is a hardened magma plug from an extinct volcano. The site was used as a Buddhist monastery from the 3rd century BCE, with caves prepared and donated by devotees to the sangha.`,

The city lies in the midst of hills in the Kandy plateau, which crosses an area of tropical plantations, mainly tea. Kandy is both an administrative and religious city and is also the capital of the Central Province.

Kandy is the home of the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1988. The city and the region have been known by many different names and versions of those names. Some scholars suggest that the original name of Kandy was Katubulu Nuwara located near the present Watapuluwa. However, the more popular historical name is Senkadagala or Senkadagalapura, officially Senkadagala Siriwardhana Maha Nuwara (meaning 'great city of Senkadagala of growing resplendence'), generally shortened to 'Maha Nuwara'.

The city is a world heritage site declared by UNESCO, in part due to the temple. Kandy is the second largest city of the island and the capital of Central Province of Sri Lanka. It is also the administrative capital of Kandy District.`,

The heritage value of the fort has been recognized by the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a cultural heritage UNESCO World Heritage site under criteria iv, for its unique exposition of "an urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries."

The city is home to some of the most sacred Buddhist sites in the world, including the Sri Maha Bodhi tree, which is said to be a sapling from the original Bodhi tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment. This makes it one of the oldest living trees in the world, planted in 288 BC.

Anuradhapura is also famous for its massive dagobas (stupas), including the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavanaramaya, and Abhayagiri stupas. These architectural marvels showcase the advanced engineering skills of ancient Sri Lankan civilization.

The city was abandoned in 993 AD due to repeated invasions from South India, and the capital was moved to Polonnaruwa. However, the sacred city continued to be maintained by Buddhist monks and pilgrims, preserving its religious significance.
